## About the User 
- This is just a for fun app, created for a class project
- If you ever need to sort a group of people into 4 groups, this would also be an excellent idea to use
- The issue being if all 4 groups will be of equal numbers.

## Features
- when a text field is entered and submitted, that string is added into an array and randomly assigned a hogwarts house.
- if no text was entered an alert will be displayed requesting text to be applied
- student cards can be expelled via button click and moved into a new array.
- This new array is for Voldemort's army.
